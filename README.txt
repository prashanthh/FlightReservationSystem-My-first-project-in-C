The Project we have developed is a data base project based on the operation of a airline company called Havi Airways Intl.(HAI). It commenced its operation in Jan 1988 with solitary Boeing 707, ferrying passengers between Delhi and Mumbai twice a week. A total commitment to quality in terms of customers satisfactory enabled HAI to earn prestigious National Service Excellence award and also a respectable profit of Rs.3 million in its very first year of operation.

By Sep.1991, the management of HAI had purchased two Boeing 742's and two Airbus 310's to service passengers traffic. They had also expanded operations to offer ten flights per week covering five cities in five states. They will however, operate only one flight to a destination on any given day.
